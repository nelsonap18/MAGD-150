# MAGD-150

**This is Alexa Nelson's repository for MAGD 150, Spring 2021.**    
_I have included 4 lab assignments to view that I created using p5.js._  

#### Lab #3 - Variables, Mouse Position, & Math  
* This lab tracks mouse position as it moves to draw a purple line. 
* It also measures mouse position in relation to four squares to draw different colored circles when the mouse is within the bounds of the square. 
#### Lab #4 - Movement, Mouse, & Conditional Logic  
* Two rows of moving circles that randomly change colors were created using a for() loop. 
* Conditional logic was used with mousePressed() and keyPressed() functions to make the rows change colors and appear and disappear.
#### Lab #7 - Arrays  
* Random array values were assigned to a snowflake drawing function to animate multiple copies to resemble a snowstorm.
* An array value was set to the current mouse position value so a trail of transparent ellipses followed the mouse as it moved. 
#### Lab #8 - Images and Text  
* The content of the images and text are all related to the animated film Walt Disney's _Cinderella_.
* The mouseX and mouseY variables are used to change the gif's location and one of the image's size as the mouse moves.
* The text function was used to write text in different fonts, change the size, fill and stroke color.
